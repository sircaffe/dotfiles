# dotfiles
Personal dotfiles from my daily use software.

This repo is a portable folder that creates symbolic links to software configuration directories. This way, I can modify this repo directly and push it into a remote for backup.

### Quick get started
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/janregx/dotfiles
$ cd dotfiles/
$ python3 deploy.py
```

#### Deprecated
```console
$ ./deploy-old.sh
```
